# Privacy-Preserving DID and Document Store

A zero-knowledge proof-based system for managing decentralized identities (DIDs) and document signatures on-chain.

## Core Features

### Identity Management (DID)

1. Create privacy-preserving DIDs linked to identifiers (email/phone) and wallet addresses
2. Trusted party verification system for DID validation
3. Support for verification revocation and rejection

### Document Management

1. Submit document records on-chain (content hash + metadata)
2. Multi-party document signing (by multiple signers) with metadata for each signature
3. Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy preservation
4. Documents can be revoked and rejected
5. Documents can be transferred between DIDs (owners)
