# Privacy-Preserving DID and Document Store

A zero-knowledge proof-based system for managing decentralized identities (DIDs) and document signatures on-chain.

## Core Features

### Identity Management (DID)

1. Create privacy-preserving DIDs linked to identifiers (email/phone) and wallet addresses

   - Generate unique DID using standardized format (did:method:identifier)
   - Hash personal identifiers before storing on-chain
   - Support multiple identifier types (email, phone, social accounts)
   - Link multiple wallet addresses to a single DID
   - Store minimal on-chain data with off-chain encrypted details

2. Trusted party verification system for DID validation

   - Whitelist of authorized verifiers
   - Verifier attestation process with cryptographic signatures
   - Multiple verification levels (none, id, kyc)
   - Time-bound verification status
   - Support for verification metadata and credentials
   - Verifier reputation system

3. Support for verification revocation and rejection
   - Explicit revocation by verifiers with reason codes
   - Automatic expiration of verifications
   - Challenge/appeal process for rejected verifications
   - Blacklist system for fraudulent DIDs
   - Audit trail of verification status changes

### Document Management

1. Submit document records on-chain

   - Store document content hash (SHA-256)
   - Include metadata:
     - Document type
     - Creation timestamp
     - Expiration date (if applicable)
     - Access control rules
     - Version information
   - Support for document templates
   - Document categorization and tagging

2. Multi-party document signing

   - Sequential and parallel signing workflows
   - Role-based signing requirements
   - Signature metadata:
     - Signer DID
     - Timestamp
     - Signature type (approve, reject, acknowledge)
     - Optional comments/notes
   - Deadline management for signatures
   - Notification system for pending signatures

3. Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy preservation

   - Prove document ownership without revealing content
   - Verify signer identity without exposing personal data
   - Demonstrate document authenticity
   - Validate document attributes without disclosure
   - Support for selective disclosure of metadata

4. Document revocation and rejection

   - Multiple revocation types:
     - Owner revocation
     - System revocation
     - Expired document
     - Superseded version
   - Rejection workflow with reason codes
   - Maintain history of status changes
   - Impact on dependent documents
   - Notification of affected parties

5. Document transfer between DIDs
   - Transfer request/approval workflow
   - Maintain signature validity after transfer
   - Transfer history tracking
   - Batch transfer capabilities
   - Access control during transfer process

   - Standard document format compatibility
   - Cross-chain interoperability
   - External oracle integration

4. Performance
   - Optimized storage patterns
   - Efficient proof generation and verification
   - Scalable indexing solution
   - Caching strategy
   - Load testing requirements

## Compliance and Standards
